You are editing an existing React + Express repo. Do NOT redesign, refactor, or change anything except the exact items below. Keep layout/styling/components the same unless a specific change requires it. Ensure the site still builds, routes work, and application + email + Google Sheets logging still works.

I will attach new images to this prompt; use them exactly as described by filename.

⸻

1) Home Page changes
	1.	Fix the header text currently showing:
APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN \U2014 FEB 26, 2026
	•	Remove the literal “\U” mistake and display a normal dash/em dash (—).
	•	Fix the date to the correct current messaging (keep the same meaning, just correct formatting and date as needed).
	2.	In the section “A PROVEN PATHWAY TO ELITE FOOTBALL”, the text below the cards:
“Now, under Andy Reid Elite Soccer Academy, the programme is entering an exciting new chapter…”
	•	Make this text bigger and bolder and wrap it in quotes.

“Previous TY Course Graduates”
	4.	Change the hero background image behind the main title

2) Programme page changes
	1.	Page title: remove “The” so it becomes:

⸻

	•	In “TU BLANCHARDSTOWN” section: remove the interactive map embed and replace with a clickable card/link that opens Google Maps for the location.

Frontend (Apply flow)
	1.	In the “Player Details” step/section remove:
	•	“HIGHLIGHT VIDEO LINK”

	•	Remove required validation for highlightVideo and extra links.
	•	Update the admin application email template to NOT include highlightVideo or extra links.
	•	Update the applicant confirmation email template accordingly (reflect new structure).
	2.	Ensure email sending via Resend still works exactly as before (no changes other than fields removed).

Google Sheets logging
	1.	Update the data appended to Google Sheets so it matches the updated application process:
	•	Remove highlightVideo and extra links from the appended row.
	•	Keep the Sheets logging functional; I will update the sheet headers/columns manually if needed.
	•	Just make sure the code writes the fields that still exist, in a consistent order.

⸻

8) General / Global UI changes
	1.	Replace favicon and all “AR” badge images throughout the site:
