You are editing an existing React + Express repo. Do NOT change anything except the exact items listed below. Keep styling/layout/components the same unless a change requires updating text or swapping images. Ensure the site still builds and all pages/routes still work.

Global instruction
	•	Update text exactly as requested.
	•	Replace/remove only the specific phrases mentioned.
	•	I will attach new pictures—use them in the specified testimonial cards/sections.
	•	Do not modify any other copy, design, spacing, or components.

	•	Change/ensure the description reads:
“All sessions are led by UEFA Pro and A License coaches.”
	•	Remove the phrase/line: “Professional playing experience” (if it appears anywhere in that card).

B) “A PROVEN PATHWAY TO ELITE FOOTBALL” section
	•	In the quote/statement text under this section, update the wording so it includes:

(Replace the current “original founder and Head Coach…” or similar wording with this exact phrase.)

C) “LEARN FROM THE BEST” section (Home page)
	•	In the “ON THE TRAINING GROUND” text area:
