You are editing an existing React + Express repo. Do NOT change anything except the exact items listed below. Keep styling/layout/components the same unless a change requires updating text or removing specific images. Ensure the site still builds and all pages/routes still work.

Global instruction
	•	Update text exactly as requested.
	•	Replace/remove only the specific phrases/images mentioned.
	•	Do not modify any other copy, design, spacing, or components.

⸻

1) Home Page (scroll sections)

A) “What sets us apart” section
	•	In the Elite Coaching card/area:
	•	Change/ensure the description reads:
“All sessions are led by UEFA Pro and A License coaches.”
	•	Remove the phrase/line: “Professional playing experience” (if it appears anywhere in that card).

B) “A PROVEN PATHWAY TO ELITE FOOTBALL” section
	•	In the quote/statement text under this section, update the wording so it includes:
“Under the leadership of original founder and Head of Coaching Denis Hyland”
(Replace the current “original founder and Head Coach…” or similar wording with this exact phrase.)

C) “LEARN FROM THE BEST” section (Home page)
	•	In the “ON THE TRAINING GROUND” text area:
	•	Remove references like: “Our coaches in action with Ireland U21s squad…” (and similar mentions).
	•	Keep the section structure the same—just remove that specific text so it no longer appears.

⸻

2) Programme Page

A) “WHY CHOOSE US?” section

1) UEFA LICENSED HEAD COACHES block/card
	•	Remove the wording: “to every session” (or any sentence containing that phrase).
	•	Replace the main text with exactly:
“Andy Reid (UEFA PRO) and Denis Hyland (UEFA PRO) bring professional playing and coaching experience to this elite program.”

2) Full Time Programme block/card
	•	Ensure the text reads:
“Players train 5 days a week in a full-time professional environment.”

3) Academic Integration block/card

“We’re an Independent school working alongside Tulsa to ensure players fulfill their TY requirements while training at the hight level.”

3) Coaches Page

“ON THE TRAINING GROUND” image group
	•	In the “ON THE TRAINING GROUND” section, there is a group/grid of 5 images.
	•	Remove the two images on the right side of that group (so only 3 images remain).
	•	Keep the section layout consistent (do not redesign—just remove those two images/cards).

⸻

4) Final checks
	•	Do not change any other copy across the site.
	•	After updates:
	•	Ensure the relevant sections still render correctly on mobile/desktop.
	•	Ensure no broken layouts from text length changes.
	•	Ensure removing the two images does not leave broken spacing or empty placeholders.
