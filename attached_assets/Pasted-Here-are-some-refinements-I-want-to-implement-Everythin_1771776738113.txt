Here are some refinements I want to implement. Everything else is good — do not change anything outside these points.

1) Scroll-to-top on route change:
Right now, when I click a button/link that navigates to a new page, the new page loads at the same scroll position as the previous page. I want every navigation to a new route to start at the top of the page (scroll position 0). Implement a clean, reliable fix that works across the whole site without breaking other scrolling behavior.

2) Use my uploaded images automatically:
I will attach images to the project. Use them in the appropriate places based on their filenames. Example: an image named “Denis-Hyland-Football-Coach” should be used as Denis Hyland’s profile image. Use similar filename-to-section mapping for Andy Reid, facilities, testimonials/media images, etc. If a matching image is missing, fall back to an existing placeholder without errors.

3) Add an inline playable highlight video (Vimeo embed):
I want the highlight reel to play directly inside the website (no redirect). Create a “Highlight Reel” / “Media” section (best placement: Home page, near the outcomes/testimonials area) and embed the Vimeo player responsively with a 16:9 aspect ratio, rounded corners, and styling that matches the site design. It must be fully responsive on mobile and desktop and play inline.
Use this Vimeo embed (convert to valid JSX/React if needed; note referrerPolicy camelCase):

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
  <iframe
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1167134116?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
    title="Academy-Highlight-Reel">
  </iframe>
</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

If the script tag is not needed, omit it safely. Keep the same behavior (inline play).

4) Coaches page: replace “Support Staff” section with “Education Partner: Litton Lane”
On the Coaches page, remove the generic support staff placeholders. Replace with a single partner card/section:
- Title: “Education Partner”
- Name: “Litton Lane”
- Description (short): “Litton Lane supports the programme’s education pillar, delivering personal training learning and certification throughout the year.”
Use the image I attached named “Litton-Lane” as the partner logo/photo.
